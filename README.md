# Repository Pattern

Sometimes, it is required to define some logic between our business logic and data access logic. That logic can be defined using a Repository pattern. Basically, Repository pattern is a mediator between two layers. Repository pattern are mostly used where we need to modify the data before passing to the next stage.

## Benefits of Repository Pattern

1-It centralizes data logic or business logic and service logic.<br />
2-It gives a substitution point for the unit tests.<br />
3-Provides a flexible architecture.<br />
4-If you want to modify the data access logic or business access logic, you donâ€™t need to change the repository logic.<br />

## Generic Repository Pattern

Sometimes, it is required or it is best to make all the repository logic in one place using the generic logic. We can create only one repository class which will be responsible for handling the entire scenario. It can be a logic between repository and data access or it can be a logic between business logic and repository. In all cases, we only write a single repository. The main benefit of the Generic Repository Pattern is the reusability of code.

## Benefits of Generic Repository Pattern

1-It reduces the redundancy of code.<br />
2-It forces programmers to work using the same pattern.<br />
3-It creates the possibility of less error.<br />
4-If you use this pattern then it is easy to maintain the centralized data access logic.<br />

## Disadvantages:
1-Excessive Abstraction: Using Generic Repository can sometimes lead to excessive abstraction of functionality. This can make it challenging to add custom behavior for specific entities or business requirements.<br/>
2-Performance Issues: Generic Repository may cause performance issues, especially when working with large datasets. Using custom-tailored queries can be more effective for performance, especially in such cases.
3-Database Dependency: The Generic Repository design pattern is often dependent on the underlying database technology. This can introduce additional workload during database changes or migrations.<br/>

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the decision to use or not use the Generic Repository depends on project requirements, team preferences, and application architecture. If simple CRUD operations are needed, and the application is on a smaller scale, using Generic Repository can be beneficial. However, for larger and more complex projects, developing custom database access layers that better suit specific requirements might be more logical.
